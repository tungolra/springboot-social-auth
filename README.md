# Spring Boot Social Authorization

### About
Starter code for integrating social logins using GitHub and Google OAuth2.0 as authentication providers. jQuery is used on the front end, Bootstrap for minimal styling. 

### What I Learned 
- Some methods can no longer be used in newer versions of Java so I had to rebuild my POM file using Java 1.8 and Spring Boot 2.2.2 to follow this tutorial. 
- Using Spring Boot's native OAuth 2.0 support simplified the building of this application. 
- Creating a Client Application that uses the authorization code grant to obtain access tokens from Authorization Servers. 
- Conditional rendering using jQuery for HTML files
